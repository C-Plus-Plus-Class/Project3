1) How do you determine the number of threads you should launch to realistically test your application
    Using more threads than the maximum amount of threads your cpu can run concurrently will test concurrent runs as
    well as series runs allowing you to test all aspects of the process
2) If you are launching several threads, under what circumstances would these threads not run in parallel on a modern processor
    If you are launching more threads than double the amount of cores on your processor. Most modern processors support
    hyper-threading meaning each core can run 2 threads. In this case some threads would run in parallel however some
    would have to run in series
